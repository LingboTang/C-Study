"Class = Data + Methods"

Class inheritance, which allows new types to be constructed by inheriting attributes from other types, is a corner stone of OO programming, which helps maintaining
large software projects.

Note that the redundant struct prefix is no longer needed.

Public: the data/method is accessible to all methods and the owner of the class variable

Private: data/method is only accessible to methods but not to the object owner

Protected: similar to private, used with class inheritance. Method of derived class have access, but the object owner does not. (We will discuss this in more detail later).

Default is Private.
