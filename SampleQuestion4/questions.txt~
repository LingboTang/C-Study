1. Using C++ type casts, write a function that reverses the byte order of an int variable.
		See ReverseByte.cpp

2. Static_cast: Used for standard (numerical) conversions No run-time check


reinterpret_cast: Conversion from one pointer type to any other pointer type

const_cast:	 toggles status: const <-> non-const

dynamic_cast: Used for "walking up and down the type hierarchy"

				Is a non-trivial run-time check, which may slow down your program

				For it to work, the source type must be polymorphic

	
3. What are static variables defined outside any class definitions and functions?

	Helper function local to a certain file, protect it from other files access

4. What is the purpose of static class variables?
	
	persistent global variable constructed when defined function first executed.
	
	Thread-safe, can let multiple execution threads call simultaneously


5. What is the lifetime of static variables defined in functions?

	Constructed during the first call, reused thereafter,
	Destroyed in reverse order of their construction.

6. How can you enforce initializing order of global variables?
	
	Wrap global objects in access functions like so.
	Given that in Namespace

7. Explain the concept of operator overloading.
	
	Made the operators generic, then when you use those operator,
	there's no difference between built-in types and class types-
	we want to be able to define what operators do when applied to 
	our own classes.

8. Define operator arity, associativity, and precedence.

	arity: How many parameters the operators use
	associativity: Left or Right first?
	precedence: which operator get's evaluated first

9. What is the effect of the following code: int a, *p, *q; ... a = *p++ - *--q;

	Define an int value a, allocate 4 bytes of int to a tmp register
	Define an int pointer p, allocate the 4 bytes address to the tmp register
	Define an int pointer q, allocate the 4 bytes address to the tmp register

	*p++ means *(p++), *--q means *(q--)
	Therefore, a= *p++ - *q-- means, evaluate a to be substraction between the address of p+1
	and q-1
